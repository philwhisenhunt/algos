<?php
//1) Create an abstract class called "Animal". It should have one 
//abstract function "speak" that requires no arguments and expects a return type of a string.
abstract Class Animal{
    abstract public function speak() : string{
        
    }
}

//2) Create another class called "Dog" which extends the class 
//"Animal". Implement the "speak" function and have it return the string "woof".



//3) Get an instantiated instance of the class "Dog". Call the
//function/method "speak" on the instantiated instance and print the result.
