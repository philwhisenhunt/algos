<?php
//1) Create an abstract class called "Animal". It should have one 
//abstract function "speak" that requires no arguments and expects a return type of a string.

//2) Create another class called "Dog" which extends the class 
//"Animal". Implement the "speak" function and have it return the string "woof".

//3) Get an instantiated instance of the class "Dog". Call the
//function/method "speak" on the instantiated instance and print the result.

abstract class Animal {
    abstract function speak(){
        //return something with a type of string
    }
